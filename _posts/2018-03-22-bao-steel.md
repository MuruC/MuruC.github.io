Bao Steel is an interactive documentary. It is about one of the oldest steel factories, Bao Steel factory in Bao Shan, Shanghai – how the factory influences residents, infrastructures, economy of Bao Shan, immigrants, etc. We made a physical map by laser cutting on cardboard and projection mapping. We 3d printed some building models. When the audience touched the building, the installation would play the video clip that was related to that building.

I did all laser cutting, audio recording, interview, coding and some parts of video editing. David Lin was the director and did main video editing.

## Interaction(Mixc Mall Version)

The project was displayed in INFINITE·NEW BORN show in Mixc Mall, held by NYU Shanghai.

I made the physical map of Shanghai by laser cutting and 3d printed the models of constructions. The color map was projectted on the physical map. When the audience pressed the building model, they could watch the documentary pieces accrodingly.

## Three documentary pieces.

## Ideation & Development

Firstly, I interviewed professor Lena about Bao Steel Factory

See the [Interview record](https://youtu.be/qeeOhHKZQQs) on Youtube.

Originally we shot the factory itself, but at last we decided to shoot the community around the factory, displaying how Bao steel factory influences people’s life. In the original idea, there would be two videos on the screen simultaneously, the con and the pro. But ann said it was too obvious so we combine the cons and pros together. We don’t want to judge the Bao steel, but show all the contradictions to the audience and let them judge.

We made the physic map because we wanted to show the geography information. Bao steel is far away from the city center. As we interviewed, we found that although the housing price was low because it is far away from the city center, but as economy developed, the housing price is higher and higher, and the workers cannot afford the price, so they move to the towns outside the Shanghai.
