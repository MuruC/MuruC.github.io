Meow Meow day is a narrative game made by Unity. The player adopts three cats that have different personality. Player should decide daily activity schedule for them and choose the right chat choice according to their characteristics.

All art assets are original work in addition to programming.


## Concept and purpose

“Depression” as one of the most common mental illnesses is predicted to become the second biggest worldwide disease in 2020. Sadly, it is neglected sometimes as it is too familiar to this fast pace society. <i>2019</i> is a sculpture artwork made of 2019 pieces of trash, designed to visualize what we as designers consider “depression condition” is, address its influence on its sufferers, and bring mental health awareness to the public.

Many sufferers choose to hide their negative emotions and we can hardly tell whether one is struggling. The depressed do not open up easily — only when we walk into one’s heart will we realize how much pain is hidden up there. Therefore, <i>2019</i> is represented as a 1/2 human heart with visual characteristics a such: being hung upside down, with a messy cross section but a clean outside surface. We aim to implement the unexpected psychological condition of the depressed. We would like to point out the paradoxical condition as audience observe the sculpture from the outside to the inside. The "self" is completely exposed to the public, to those who do not know him/her. The use of trash acts as a metaphor while also echoing the idea of recycled art.

## Collection and Cleaning Process

All used cups in this sculpture were collected from Burger King and Starbucks, small trash pieces were from our daily use. We handwashed them all during preparation process.

## Result and Interaction

<i>2019</i> is meaningful both in itself as an art medium and to the environment. It turns a pure physical sculpture into an interactive installation that “expresses emotions”. When audience pull the “vessels” of the heart, 2019 creates heartbeats, and a sculpture without any digital devices is no longer “still” but “alive.” There are lots of small trash pieces filling the cross section of the heart, meaning those little painful moments one has experienced. Audience are encouraged to dispose of some trash pieces from the sculpture into trashcans, meaning a clean-up of people’s emotional trash and the environment. Depression does not stay with one for good, while those negative emotions can be recycled to something useful, positive and bright.
