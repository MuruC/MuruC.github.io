Oblivision is a narrative game. I was inspired by Chinese
ancient story Meng Po. In Meng Po, the soul of the dead will drink
the tea of oblivion to forget everything, before it becomes human
again. The player will perceive the emotion in the story and help
souls forget their life.

## Concept Design

It is a narrative game. The protagonist is a ghost who loses
memory and works in the hell. She is the 17th Meng Po in this
area. Other ghosts call her Meng 17th.
Meng 17th needs to deal with the souls who are going
to become human again. They will tell their stories about how
they died and their life to the player. Player needs to choose the
ingredients to make the tea of oblivion. When the soul drinks the
tea of oblivion, it will forget everything.

*<b>Tea of Oblivion</b>:

The tea of oblivion consists of eight types of tears: the tear
of birth, regret, illness, old, bitter, lovesick, separation, and the
sorrow of Meng Po. This defination derives from ancient Chinese
myth and Buddhism. In Buddhism, people will have eight kinds
of suffering throughout their life. Player needs to evaluate the
emotions in the soul's life story and make the tea of oblivion. For
example, if the character lost his beloved when he was a human,
player is supposed to add the tear of lovesick to the tea.

*<b>The Hell</b>:

The hell in Chinese myth is quite different from the hell in
western culture. Every soul will go to the hell and be judged by the
officials in the hell. Innocent soul will go to the river of Oblivion.
Guilty soul will receive punishment. In the game, the hell is pretty
modern. It is devided into numerous districts. Every districts has
a Meng Po and other basic officials. And it has applied many
automatic systems. The hell exists where people believe mysterious
power will judge the soul.
The system will collect the eight flavour tears from the
human in this region. So everyday the amount of tears is not
sustainable.

*<b>Emotion load degree</b>:

Because Meng Po is supposed to deal with human's emotion
and memory, she will be influenced by them and has emotion load
degree. If the degree is very high, Meng Po may not stand it and
vanish. This is why Meng Po usually lose memory before they
become Meng Po.

### 路 Meng 17th

<b>	Background story</b>

Meng 17th had mental disease
before she died - she had short-term
amnesia. She couldn't remember
things happened seventeen days
before. She tried not to pay emotion
to others, nor have too inimate
relationship with others, in order not
to be frustrated or hurt others.

<b>	Current situation</b>

Because she used to have difficulty in perceiving memory, she
could stand very high level of emotion load degree. Thus, she was
chosen to be the 17th Meng Po.

### 路 Meng 16th

<b>	Background story</b>

She was a painter. When the
Messenger brought her to
the hell, the pieces that store

She reach to the extremity of her emotion load degree, thus her
soul almost collapse. Fortunately, she had completed enough tasks.
She could choose to become human or to be higher level official
in the hell. She chooses the later one because she thinks the life in
the hell is interesting.
